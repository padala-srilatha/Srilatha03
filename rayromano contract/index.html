    <section id="section8">
        <h2>JAMIE FLOYD: <em>UPPER WEST SIDE CLASSIC 6</em></h2>
        <p>"Ray Romano rocks. Listen to this: He did a complete GUT on an eight-room wreck 
          in less than 8 weeks. I do not recommend it for anyone. It is CRAZY. But <br>
           we have little kids and we had no choice. Ray Romano and his team got it done! The place is beautiful!"</p>

        <h2>DONNA AND SCOTT: <em>RESCUED RENOVATION </em></h2>
        <p>"Ray rescued us from a contractor job gone bad. He and his crew are great, 
          neat and real artisans. We recommend him very highly and I bet before we know
          <br> it, there will be another "Everybody loves Raymond," but on HGTV or TLC!"</p>

        <h2>DAVID SIEGEL: <em>DOUBLED THE VALUE </em></h2>
        <p>"Ray added value in ways that other G.C.s can't. Working with him is a pleasure. 
          He more than doubled the value of my apartment through his gut 
        <br> renovations. I would recommend him to any person looking to make home improvements."</p>
